These are the sources and binaries for some unreleased dependencies of
Cockpit.

To build a new package, use the "update" program in this directory.
For example:

   $ ./update fedora-20/accountsservice

This will install new binary packages in the right place somewhere in
this directory tree and will update the repository metadata.

Then review the changes, commit, and push.
